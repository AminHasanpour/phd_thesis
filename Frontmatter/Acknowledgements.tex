I see the PhD as a journey of personal growth, full of challenges, learning experiences, and achievements. I could not have taken this journey alone, and I am deeply grateful to all those who supported, encouraged, and believed in me along the way.

At the beginning of my PhD, I faced the challenge of adapting to a new country, culture, and working environment. I was incredibly fortunate to have the support of my supervisor, Fontas, and my dear colleague, Emil Njor, during this time. Their kindness, friendship, and unwavering help made those early days, and the years that followed, much easier and far more enjoyable.

Dear Fontas, I feel truly lucky to have had you as my supervisor. Throughout these years, you have always been supportive, understanding, and deeply professional. Your guidance, trust, and insightful feedback have shaped both my research and my personal development. Thank you for giving me the freedom to explore my ideas and for always believing in my abilities.

I would also like to express my gratitude to my co-supervisor, Jan Madsen, for giving me the opportunity to start this journey in the first place. My sincere thanks also go to my colleagues at the Embedded Systems Engineering (ESE) section at DTU Compute. You created a warm, welcoming, and inspiring working environment. Although I wish I had spent more time with you, I truly valued every conversation, shared laugh, and lunch we had together.

I am sincerely grateful for the support of our industrial partners, Grundfos and VELUX. In particular, I would like to thank Thorkild Kvisgaard, John Bomholt, and Glenn Andreasen. Your collaboration, openness, and valuable insights greatly enriched my research experience, and I have learned a great deal from working with you. It has been a pleasure to share ideas and develop solutions together.

To my friends, thank you for being there for me. Your companionship turned difficult times into bearable ones and ordinary days into memorable moments. I am grateful for the laughter, the meaningful conversations, and the support you have given me. A very special thank you goes to my dearest friend, Javad, whose presence and friendship have helped me grow into a better person.

Finally, a special thanks to my family:
