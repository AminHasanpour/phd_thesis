   abstract = {Cavitation is one of the major disadvantages in pumping system, which enhance to form bubbles in the pipeline and it reduces the efficiency of the pump. So it should be identified and take the preventive measure. Machine Learning is a fast and computational method which can easily detect any faults in the pumping system. Still now lots of work has been done on a detection of fault in the pumping system, but mainly those work has done based on vibration details and variation of speed. The paper presents how by the help of machine learning algorithm by varying the speed and pressure cavitation can be identified. It is the comparative study between how the vibration and speed together affects the cavitation result and variation of speed and pressure affects the cavitation. Support Vector Machine is one of the classification methods in machine learning algorithm where it can be easily classified the cavitation problem. So this paper analyses how the method of SVM can more efficiently detect the cavitation problem with the centrifugal water pump.},

   abstract = {Cavitation in pumps causes destructive consequences and occurs at certain operating circumstances. Therefore, it must be detected and prevented. The main thrust of the present work is detection and investigation of cavitation in a centrifugal pump experimentally, by monitoring the flow characteristics as well as the vibration spectrum. It is an attempt to declare the discrete signature of cavitation at various strengths on the vibration spectrum. The experimental results on a centrifugal pump at a rotational speed of 2850 rpm and absolute values of suction pressures from 10 to 78 kPa, showed that the inception of cavitation is declared by sudden deterioration in the hydraulic characteristics, decrease in the efficiency and increase in the overall vibration level. As the cavitation strength increases, the vibration level decreases and then increases sharply. Cavitation can be detected by online monitoring of the vibration amplitude of the discrete frequencies corresponding to the pump rotational speed and the first blade passing. As the pump operation moves from no-cavitation to cavitation case, the vibration amplitude of the rotational speed frequency increases while it decreases for the first passing frequency. Also, the cavitation in pumps signs the vibration spectrum by appearance of high energy at high frequencies.},

Cavitation is a common undesired phenomenon in centrifugal pumps, which causes damage and its detection in the preliminary stage is very important. In this paper, cavitation is identified by use of vibration and current signal and artificial immune network that is modeled on the base of the human immune system. For this purpose, first data collection were done by a laboratory setup in health and five stages damage condition; then various features in time, frequency, and time–frequency were extracted from vibration and current signals in addition to pressure and flow rate; next feature selection and dimensions reduction were done by artificial immune method to use for classification; finally, they were used by artificial immune network and some other methods to identify the system condition and classification. The results of this study showed that this method is more accurate in the detection of cavitation in the initial stage compared to methods such as non-linear supportive vector machine, multi-layer artificial neural network, K-means and fuzzy C-means with the same data. Also, selected features with artificial immune system were better than principal component analysis results.},

   abstract = {Detection of cavitation in centrifugal pumps is critical in their condition monitoring. In order to detect cavitation more accurately and confidently, more advanced signal processing techniques are needed. For the classification of a pump conditions based on the outputs of these techniques, advanced machine learning techniques are needed. In this research, an automatic system for cavitation detection is proposed based on machine learning. Bispectral analysis is used for analyzing the vibration signals. The resulting bispectrum images are given to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as inputs. The CNNs are a pretrained AlexNet and a pretrained GoogleNet, which are used in this application through transfer learning. On the contrary, a laboratory test setup is used for generating controlled cavitation in a centrifugal pump. The suggested algorithm is implemented on the vibration dataset acquired from the laboratory pump test setup. The results show that the cavitation state of the pump can be detected accurately using this system without any need to image processing or feature extraction.},

   abstract = {Vibration is a common side effect of cavitation in centrifugal pumps, which are also affected by other physical processes. Therefore, the study of cavitation based on raw vibration signals may introduce potential discrepancies under practical operating conditions. With the objective of accurately identifying the cavitation stages in a centrifugal pump, this study employs the wavelet packet transform (WPT) to process the original signal. Subsequently, the different vibration acceleration signals obtained by processing the raw signals using the proposed method under different working conditions are compared. The unequal interval weight grey (UIWG) model is proposed based on the measurements performed to reconstruct the functional relationship between cavitation and vibration, including in cases where the physical parameters of the research object are unavailable. The results reveal that the post-signal energy exhibits monotonic characteristics in certain frequency bands, despite the presence of interference under practical operating conditions. In addition, the UIWG model is verified to be robust as it is capable of self-correcting its monotonicity based on limited discrete data. In conclusion, the UIWG model equipped with WPT is an effective means to predict cavitation-induced vibrations.},

Therefore, in this study the cavitation performance of an axial flow pump is monitored based on vibration signals. For this purpose, experimental vibration data is collected for five different levels of cavitation. Time-domain features are extracted based on statistical behavior of the measured signals. Considering the nonlinear and high-frequency nature of the cavitation noise in the signal, the second set of features including both time- and frequency-domain parameters are obtained based on statistical behavior of the first intrinsic mode function, via empirical mode decomposition combined with Hilbert Huang transform. Compensation distance evaluation technique is applied to pick the appropriate features. Multi-class support vector machine is trained for classification of the various levels of cavitation intensity. The results of testing the support vector machine algorithm show that the developed methodology can monitor the pump’s cavitation intensity in onsite operation with high accuracy.},

One of the important mechanisms that affect the steady and dynamic operation of a pump is cavitation, which appears in the low static pressure zone formed at the impeller entrance region. This paper investigates the inception and development of cavitation in three different impellers of a laboratory centrifugal pump with a Plexiglas casing, using flow visualization, vibration and acoustic emission measurements. The aim of this study is the development of an experimental tool that detects cavitation in different impellers and the further understanding of the effects of blade geometry in cavitation development. The results show that the geometrical characteristics of the impeller affect cavitation development and behavior, while an acoustic emission sensor and an accelerometer can be applied for successfully detecting the onset of this mechanism.},

   abstract = {Cavitation is a challenging flow abnormality that leads to undesirable effects on the energy performance of the centrifugal pump and the reliable operation of the pump system. The onset and mechanism of a phenomenon that results in unsteady cavitation must be realised to ensure a reliable operation of pumps under the cavitation state. This study focuses on cavitation instability at normal flow rate, at which point the unsteady cavitation occurs as the available net positive suction head (NPSHa) falls below 5.61 m for the researched pump. An ameliorative algorithm–united algorithm for cavitation vibration analysis is proposed on the basis of short time Fourier transform (STFT) and Wigner–Ville distribution (WVD). The STFT–WVD method is then tested using vibration data measured from the centrifugal pump. The relationship between vibration and suction performance indicates that the inception and development of cavitation can be effectively detected by the distribution and intensity of the united algorithm at the testing points. Intermediate frequency components at approximately 6 kHz fluctuate initially with the development of cavitation. A time–frequency characteristic is found to be conducive to monitoring the cavitation performance of centrifugal pumps.},

   abstract = {The scope of this study is the evaluation of early detection methods for cavitation phenomena in centrifugal irrigation pumps by analyzing the produced vibration and sound signals from a low-cost sensor and data acquisition system and comparing several computational methods. Vibration data was acquired using the embedded accelerometer sensor of a smartphone device. Sound signals were obtained using the embedded microphone of the same commercial smartphone. The analysis was based on comparing the signals in different operating conditions with reference to the best efficiency operating point of the pump. In the case of vibrations, data was acquired for all three directional axes. The signals were processed by computational methods to extract the relative features in the frequency domain and use them to train an artificial neural network to be able to identify the different pump operating conditions while the cavitation phenomenon evolves. Three different classification algorithms were used to examine the most preferable approach for classifying data, namely the Classification Tree, the K-Nearest Neighbor, and the Support Vector Data algorithms. In addition, a convolutional neural network was utilized to examine the success rate of the classification when the datasets were formed as spectrograms instead. A detailed comparison of the classification algorithms and different axes was conducted. Comparing the results of the different methods for vibration and sound datasets, classification accuracy showed that in the case of vibration, the detection of cavitation in real conditions is possible, while it proves more challenging to identify cavitation conditions using sound data obtained with low-cost commercial sensors.},

   abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) has a great impact by automatically designing effective neural network architectures. However, the prohibitive computational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (e.g. $10^4$ GPU hours) makes it difficult to \emph{directly} search the architectures on large-scale tasks (e.g. ImageNet). Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t. candidate set size). As a result, they need to utilize~\emph{proxy} tasks, such as training on a smaller dataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs. These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. In this paper, we present \emph{ProxylessNAS} that can \emph{directly} learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms. We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of directness and specialization. On CIFAR-10, our model achieves 2.08\% test error with only 5.7M parameters, better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture AmoebaNet-B, while using 6$\times$ fewer parameters. On ImageNet, our model achieves 3.1\% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2, while being 1.2$\times$ faster with measured GPU latency.

   abstract = {We address the challenging problem of efficient inference across many devices and resource constraints, especially on edge devices. Conventional approaches either manually design or use neural architecture search (NAS) to find a specialized neural network and train it from scratch for each case, which is computationally prohibitive (causing $CO_2$ emission as much as 5 cars' lifetime) thus unscalable. In this work, we propose to train a once-for-all (OFA) network that supports diverse architectural settings by decoupling training and search, to reduce the cost. We can quickly get a specialized sub-network by selecting from the OFA network without additional training. To efficiently train OFA networks, we also propose a novel progressive shrinking algorithm, a generalized pruning method that reduces the model size across many more dimensions than pruning (depth, width, kernel size, and resolution). It can obtain a surprisingly large number of sub-networks ($> 10^{19}$) that can fit different hardware platforms and latency constraints while maintaining the same level of accuracy as training independently. On diverse edge devices, OFA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) NAS methods (up to 4.0\% ImageNet top1 accuracy improvement over MobileNetV3, or same accuracy but 1.5x faster than MobileNetV3, 2.6x faster than EfficientNet w.r.t measured latency) while reducing many orders of magnitude GPU hours and $CO_2$ emission. In particular, OFA achieves a new SOTA 80.0\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the mobile setting ($<$600M MACs). OFA is the winning solution for the 3rd Low Power Computer Vision Challenge (LPCVC), DSP classification track and the 4th LPCVC, both classification track and detection track.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning scheme for CNNs to simultaneously 1) reduce the model size; 2) decrease the run-time memory footprint ; and 3) lower the number of computing operations, without compromising accuracy. This is achieved by enforcing channel-level sparsity in the network in a simple but effective way. Different from many existing approaches, the proposed method directly applies to modern CNN architec-tures, introduces minimum overhead to the training process, and requires no special software/hardware accelerators for the resulting models.

We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several state-of-the-art CNN models, including VGGNet, ResNet and DenseNet, on various image classification datasets. For VGGNet, a multi-pass version of network slimming gives a 20× reduction in model size and a 5× reduction in computing operations.},

   abstract = {A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

@article{Banbury2021,
   abstract = {Executing machine learning workloads locally on resource constrained microcontrollers (MCUs) promises to drastically expand the application space of IoT. However, so-called TinyML presents severe technical challenges, as deep neural network inference demands a large compute and memory budget. To address this challenge, neural architecture search (NAS) promises to help design accurate ML models that meet the tight MCU memory, latency and energy constraints. A key component of NAS algorithms is their latency/energy model, i.e., the mapping from a given neural network architecture to its inference latency/energy on an MCU. In this paper, we observe an intriguing property of NAS search spaces for MCU model design: on average, model latency varies linearly with model operation (op) count under a uniform prior over models in the search space. Exploiting this insight, we employ differentiable NAS (DNAS) to search for models with low memory usage and low op count, where op count is treated as a viable proxy to latency. Experimental results validate our methodology, yielding our MicroNet models, which we deploy on MCUs using Tensorflow Lite Micro, a standard open-source NN inference runtime widely used in the TinyML community. MicroNets demonstrate state-of-the-art results for all three TinyMLperf industry-standard benchmark tasks: visual wake words, audio keyword spotting, and anomaly detection.

@article{Ghanathe2023,
   abstract = {Deploying Machine learning (ML) on milliwatt-scale edge devices (tinyML) is gaining popularity due to recent breakthroughs in ML and Internet of Things (IoT). Most tinyML research focuses on model compression techniques that trade accuracy (and model capacity) for compact models to fit into the KB-sized tiny-edge devices. In this paper, we show how such models can be enhanced by the addition of an early exit intermediate classifier. If the intermediate classifier exhibits sufficient confidence in its prediction, the network exits early thereby, resulting in considerable savings in time. Although early exit classifiers have been proposed in previous work, these previous proposals focus on large networks, making their techniques suboptimal/impractical for tinyML applications. Our technique is optimized specifically for tiny-CNN sized models. In addition, we present a method to alleviate the effect of network overthinking by leveraging the representations learned by the early exit. We evaluate T-RecX on three CNNs from the MLPerf tiny benchmark suite for image classification, keyword spotting and visual wake word detection tasks. Our results show that T-RecX 1) improves the accuracy of baseline network, 2) achieves 31.58% average reduction in FLOPS in exchange for one percent accuracy across all evaluated models. Furthermore, we show that our methods consistently outperform popular prior works on the tiny-CNNs we evaluate.},

@article{Njor2023,
   abstract = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a popular tool for automatically generating Neural Network (NN) architectures. In early NAS works, these tools typically optimized NN architectures for a single metric, such as accuracy. However, in the case of resource constrained Machine Learning, one single metric is not enough to evaluate a NN architecture. For example, a NN model achieving a high accuracy is not useful if it does not fit inside the flash memory of a given system. Therefore, recent works on NAS for resource constrained systems have investigated various approaches to optimize for multiple metrics. In this paper, we propose that, on top of these approaches, it could be beneficial for NAS optimization of resource constrained systems to also consider input data granularity. We name such a system "Data Aware NAS", and we provide experimental evidence of its benefits by comparing it to traditional NAS.},
